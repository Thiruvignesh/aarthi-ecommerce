# Getting Started with React

This guide will help you set up a basic React project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

## Setting Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd aar-ecomerce
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open your React application in the default web browser.

## Building the Project

To create a production build of your application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `build` directory.
